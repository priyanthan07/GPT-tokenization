Her versatile artistry, songwriting, and entrepreneurship have influenced the music industry, popular culture, and politics, and her life is a subject of widespread media coverage.\\nSwift began professional songwriting at 14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country singer. She released six studio albums under the label, four of them to country radio, starting with Taylor Swift (2006). Her next, Fearless (2008), explored country pop, and its singles \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" catapulted her to mainstream fame. Speak Now (2010) infused rock influences, while Red (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift\\'s first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\". She departed from her country image with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-influenced Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\\nAfter signing with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the eclectic pop album Lover (2019) and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She explored indie folk styles on the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, subdued electropop on Midnights (2022), and re-recorded four albums subtitled Taylor\\'s Version after a dispute with Big Machine. These albums spawned the number-one songs \"Cruel Summer\", \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"All Too Well\", and \"Is It Over Now?\". Her Eras Tour (2023–2024) and its accompanying concert film became the highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time, respectively. Swift has directed several music videos and films such as Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short Film (2021).\\nOne of the world\\'s best-selling musicians, with over 200 million records sold as of 2019, Swift has been named Global Recording Artist of the Year three times by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, whereas six of her albums have opened with over a million sales in a week.

So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different.\"[26] She spent summers in Stone Harbor, New Jersey until she was 14 years old, performing in a local coffee shop.[27][28]\\nWhen Swift was around 12 years old, musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. Cremer helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write \"Lucky You\".[29] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York–based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their \"Rising Stars\" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and met with major record labels.[30] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift, then 13 years old, was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[31][32][33] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch\\'s Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[12][34] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[35] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[36][37]\\n2004–2008: Career beginnings and first album\\nIn Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[38][39] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[40] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[41] Rose called the sessions \"some of the easiest I\\'ve ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She\\'d write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she\\'d come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[42] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label\\'s lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people\\'s stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[33][23] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[43]\\nTaylor Swift singing on a microphone and playing a guitar\\nSwift opening for Brad Paisley in 2007. To promote her first album, she opened tours for other country musicians in 2007 and 2008.[44]\\nAt an industry showcase at Nashville\\'s Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[45] She was one of Big Machine\\'s first signings,[33] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[46][47] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[23] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[48] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[49] Country Weekly critic Chris Neal deemed Swift better than previous aspiring teenage country singers because of her \"honesty, intelligence and idealism\".[50] The album peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[51] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a US platinum-certified debut album.[52]\\nBig Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations. As there was not enough furniture at the label yet, they would sit on the floor to do so.[53] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[54] as a replacement for Eric Church.[55] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[53][12]\\nFollowing \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should\\'ve Said No\". All appeared on Billboard\\'s Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should\\'ve Said No\" reaching number one. With \"Our Song\", Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a number-one song on the chart.[56] \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" reached number thirteen on the US Billboard Hot 100.[57] Swift also released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[58][59] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians\\' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[60] Brad Paisley,[61] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[62]\\nSwift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association\\'s Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person given the title.[63] She also won the Country Music Association\\'s Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[64] the Academy of Country Music Awards\\' Top New Female Vocalist,[65] and the American Music Awards\\' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[66] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[67] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again[68] and briefly dated the singer Joe Jonas.[69][70]\\n2008–2010: Fearless\\nTaylor Swift in 2009\\nSwift at the 2009 premiere of Hannah Montana: The Movie.

The first single peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one in Australia.[57][76] It was the first country song to top Billboard\\'s Pop Songs chart.[77] \"You Belong with Me\" was the album\\'s highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number two,[78] and was the first country song to top Billboard\\'s all-genre Radio Songs chart.[79] All five singles were Hot Country Songs top-10 entries, with \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" topping the chart.[80] Fearless became her first number-one album on the Billboard 200 and 2009\\'s top-selling album in the US.[81] The Fearless Tour, Swift\\'s first headlining concert tour, grossed over $63 million.[82] Journey to Fearless, a documentary miniseries, aired on television and was later released on DVD and Blu-ray.[83] Swift performed as a supporting act for Keith Urban\\'s Escape Together World Tour in 2009.[84]\\nIn 2009, the music video for \"You Belong with Me\" was named Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[85] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper Kanye West,[86] an incident that became the subject of controversy, widespread media attention and Internet memes.[87] That year she won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[88] Billboard named her 2009\\'s Artist of the Year.[89] She won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year for \"Love Story\" at the 2009 CMT Music Awards, where she made a parody video of the song with rapper T-Pain called \"Thug Story\".[90] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and \"White Horse\" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance.

Swift was 2023\\'s most streamed artist on Spotify,[251] Apple Music,[252] and Amazon Music;[253] the first act to place number one on the year-end Billboard top artists list in three different decades (2009, 2015 and 2023);[254] and the first living artist to simultaneously chart five albums in the top 10 of the Billboard 200.[255] She had five out of the 10 best-selling albums of 2023 in the United States, a record since Luminate began tracking US music sales in 1991.[256][257]\\nBeyond her albums, Swift featured on five songs from 2021 to 2023: \"Renegade\" and \"Birch\" by Big Red Machine,[258] a remix of \"Gasoline\" by Haim,[259] \"The Joker and the Queen\" by Ed Sheeran,[260] and \"The Alcott\" by the National.[261] For the soundtrack of the 2022 film Where the Crawdads Sing, she recorded \"Carolina\", which received nominations for Best Original Song at the Golden Globes and Best Song Written for Visual Media at the Grammy Awards.[262] Outside of music, Swift had a supporting role in the 2022 period comedy film Amsterdam and has signed to direct an upcoming feature film for Searchlight Pictures.[263][264]\\n2023–present: The Eras Tour and The Tortured Poets Department\\nSwift singing into a mic\\nSwift on the Eras Tour in 2023\\nIn March 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, a retrospective tour covering all her studio albums. Media outlets extensively covered the tour\\'s cultural and economic impact,[265] and its US leg broke the record for the most tickets sold in a day.[245] Ticketmaster received public and political criticisms for mishandling the tour\\'s ticket sales.[266] The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing tour in history, collecting over $1 billion.[267][268] Its concert film, released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, grossed over $250 million to become the highest-grossing concert film, and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.[269][270] Swift\\'s music releases, touring, and related activities culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity post-pandemic.[271] Music Business Worldwide remarked that she entered a \"new stratosphere of global career success\" in 2023.[272]\\nSwift began dating Kansas City Chiefs\\' tight end Travis Kelce in 2023.[273] In January 2024, AI-generated fake pornographic images portraying Swift were posted to X (formerly Twitter) and spread to other social media platforms, spurring criticism and demands for legal reform.[274][275] At the 66th Grammy Awards, Swift announced her eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, set for release on April 19, 2024.[248][276]\\nArtistry\\nInfluences\\nOne of Swift\\'s earliest memories of music is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church.[5] As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: \"My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own.\"[277] Swift said she owes her confidence and \"fascination with writing and storytelling\" to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child.[278][279]\\nSwift was drawn to the storytelling aspect of country music,[280] which was introduced to the genre by female country artists of the 1990s: Shania Twain, Faith Hill, and the Dixie Chicks.[281][282] Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence.[283] Hill was Swift\\'s childhood role model, and she would often imitate her.[284] She admired the Chicks\\' defiant attitude and the way they played their instruments,[285] and was also influenced by older country stars like Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton,[22] the last of whom she believes is exemplary to female songwriters.[114] As a songwriter, Swift was influenced by Joni Mitchell\\'s emotional and autobiographical lyrics, highlighting Mitchell\\'s 1971 album Blue as a favorite \"because it explores somebody\\'s soul so deeply\".[286] She also spoke of influence from 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette,[287][288] and alt-country artists like Patty Griffin[289] and Lori McKenna.[290]\\nVarious pop and rock artists have also influenced Swift. She lists Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as her career role models.[12][291] 1989 was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Peter Gabriel, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, and Madonna.[292][293] She also cited Keith Urban\\'s musical style and Fall Out Boy\\'s lyrics as major influences.[294][295]\\nGenres\\n\"If there\\'s one thing that Swift has proven throughout her career, it\\'s that she refuses to be put in a box.

Swift described it as her first \"documented, official pop album\".[311] Her subsequent albums Reputation (2017) and Lover (2019) have an upbeat pop production; the former incorporates hip hop, trap, and EDM elements.[312][313][314] Midnights (2022), on the other hand, is distinguished by a more experimental, \"subdued and amorphous pop sound\".[315][316] Although reviews of Swift\\'s pop albums were generally positive, some critics lamented that the pop music production indicated Swift\\'s pursuit of mainstream success, eroding her authenticity as a songwriter nurtured by her country music background—a criticism that has been retrospectively described as rockist.[317][318] Musicologist Nate Sloan remarked that Swift\\'s pop music transition was rather motivated by her need to expand her artistry.[319] Swift eschewed mainstream pop in favor of alternative, folk and indie rock styles with her 2020 studio albums Folklore and Evermore.[320][321] Clash said her career \"has always been one of transcendence and covert boundary-pushing\", reaching a point at which \"Taylor Swift is just Taylor Swift\", not defined by any genre.[322]\\nVoice\\n\\n\"Cardigan\"\\nDuration: 22 seconds.0:22\\nSwift uses her lower register in \"Cardigan\" (2020).[323]\\n\"Lavender Haze\"\\nDuration: 18 seconds.0:18\\n\"Lavender Haze\" (2022) features Swift\\'s falsetto vocals in the refrain.[324]\\nProblems playing these files? See media help.\\nSwift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range,[325] and a generally soft but versatile timbre.[326][327] As a country singer, her vocals were criticized by some as weak and strained compared to those of her contemporaries.[328] Swift admitted her vocal ability often concerned her in her early career and has worked hard to improve.[329] Reviews of her vocals remained mixed after she transitioned to pop music with 1989; critics complained that she lacked proper technique but appreciated her usage of her voice to communicate her feelings to the audience, prioritizing \"intimacy over power and nuance\".[330] They also praised her for refraining from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune.[331]\\nThe Los Angeles Times remarked that Swift\\'s defining vocal feature is her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—\"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow\".[332] With Reputation, critics noted she was \"learning how to use her voice as a percussion instrument of its own\",[333] swapping her \"signature\" expressive vocals for \"cool, conversational, detached\" cadences and rhythms similar to hip hop and R&B styles.[334][335][336] Alternative Press stated that her \"evocative\" vocal stylings are more reminiscent of pop-punk and emo genres.[337]\\nReviews of Swift\\'s later albums and performances were more appreciative of her vocals, finding them less nasal, richer, more resonant, and more powerful.[304][338][339] With Folklore and Evermore, Swift received praise for her sharp and agile yet translucent and controlled voice.[340][341][342] Pitchfork described it as \"versatile and expressive\".[343] With her 2021 re-recorded albums, critics began to praise the mature, deeper and \"fuller\" tone of her voice.[344][345][346] An i review said Swift\\'s voice is \"leagues better now\".[347] The Guardian highlighted \"yo-yoing vocal yelps\" and passionate climaxes as the trademarks of Swift\\'s voice,[348] and that her country twang faded away.[349] Midnights received acclaim for Swift\\'s nuanced vocal delivery.[350] She ranked 102nd on the 2023 Rolling Stone list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[327] In a review of the Eras Tour, The New Yorker critic Amanda Petrusich praised the clarity and tone of Swift\\'s live vocals.[351] Musicologist Alyssa Barna said that Swift\\'s timbre is \"breathy and bright\" in her upper register and \"full and dark\" in the lower.[222]\\nSongwriting\\nFurther information: List of songs by Taylor Swift\\nSwift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters ever by several publications.[352][353][354] Literature scholars like Jonathan Bate and Stephanie Burt have noted that her literary and melodic sensibility and writing style are rare amongst her peers.[355][356] Swift\\'s bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[357][358] earning her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time.[359] Mojo described her as \"a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor\".[360]\\nIn The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across\".[12] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[361][362] Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[363][364] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[365][366] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[367] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[292] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift\\'s fame,[368] and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\".[369] Other themes in Swift\\'s music include family dynamics, friendship,[370][371] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[279][372]\\nHer confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[373][12][374] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music.[375][376][377] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[378][379] NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\",[335] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[379] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[12] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[380][381][382] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[383]\\nOn her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[384] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[363] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[384] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore.[385] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\".[358]\\nSwift divides her writing into three types: \"quill lyrics\", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; \"fountain pen lyrics\", based on modern and vivid storylines; and \"glitter gel pen lyrics\", which are lively and frivolous.[386] Critics note the fifth track of every Swift album as the most \"emotionally vulnerable\" of the album.[387] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers\\' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\".[388] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[389] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[245] Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You\\'re Anything Like Me\".[390]\\nPerformances\\nFurther information: List of Taylor Swift live performances\\n\\nSwift performing on the Reputation Stadium Tour in Seattle in May 2018\\nJournalists have described Swift as one of the best live performers. Often praised for her showmanship and stage presence,[391][392][393][394][395] Swift commands large audiences,[396][397][398] without having to rely on dance like her contemporaries do.[399] According to V magazine\\'s Greg Krelenstein, she possesses \"a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting\", irrespective of whether she is \"plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers\".[400] In a 2008 review of Swift\\'s early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a \"preternaturally skilled\" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding \"she returned the crowd\\'s energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen.\"[401] In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her \"seemingly endless stamina\" on the Eras Tour,[402] and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship \"unparalleled\".[403]\\nCritics have highlighted Swift\\'s versatility as an entertainer, praising her ability to switch onstage personas and performance styles depending on the varying themes and aesthetics of her albums.[404][405] Her concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology,[406] and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007.[407] Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar;[408] acoustic guitar; piano;[409] and sometimes twelve-string guitar,[410][411] banjo,[412] or ukulele.[413] Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection.[351][414] Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains \"integral to her singer-songwriter origins\".[415][409] Chris Willman of Variety called Swift \"pop\\'s most approachable superstar\",[416] and the 21st century\\'s most popular performer.[417]\\nVideo and film\\nFurther information: Taylor Swift videography\\nSwift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music-making process.[418] She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time she has become more involved with writing and directing. She developed the concept and treatment for \"Mean\" in 2011[419] and co-directed the music video for \"Mine\" with Roman White the year before.[420] In an interview, White said that Swift \"was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe.

AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015.[423] Swift produced the music video for \"Bad Blood\" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016.[424]\\nHer production company, Taylor Swift Productions, is credited with producing all of her visual media starting with the 2018 concert documentary Reputation

Drew Kirsch,[426] but first ventured into sole direction with the video for \"The Man\" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction).[427] After Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, Swift debuted as a filmmaker with All Too Well: The Short Film,[245] which made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a sole director.[428] Swift has cited Chloé Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes, and Noah Baumbach as filmmaking influences.[418]\\nAccolades and achievements\\nFurther information: List of awards and

Rosen added that Swift \"falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends\", leaving her contemporaries \"vying for second place\".[310] Critics regard Swift as a rare yet successful combination of the pop star and singer-songwriter archetypes.[497]\\nHer fans are known as Swifties.[266] Billboard noted only few artists have had her chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support.[498] Swift\\'s million-selling albums are considered an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s.[499][500] Economist Alan Krueger described Swift as an \"economic genius\".[501]\\nAlthough labeled by the media in her early career as \"America\\'s Sweetheart\" for her girl next door persona,[502][503] Swift has been accused by detractors of being \"calculated\" and manipulative of her image, a narrative bolstered by her 2016 dispute with West.[173][174] Critics have also noted that her personal life and career have been subject to intense misogyny and \"slut-shaming\",[504][505] as well as rampant media scrutiny and tabloid speculation.[506]\\nSwift\\'s private jet use has drawn scrutiny for its carbon emissions.[507][508] In 2023, a spokesperson for Swift stated that she had purchased more than double the required carbon credits to offset all tour travel and personal flights.[509][510] In December 2023, Swift\\'s lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to American programmer Jack Sweeney over tracking her private jet, citing safety concerns and stalking.[511][512] Swift has been a victim of numerous house break-ins and stalkers, some of whom were armed.[513][514]\\nLegacy\\n\"You have different artists dominating different sectors of the industry: Some are huge at streaming, some are big draws on the road.

executive director, 2023[515]\\nSwift helped shape the modern country music scene,[516] having extended her success beyond the Anglosphere,[310][516] pioneered the use of internet (Myspace) as a marketing tool,[33][53] and introduced the genre to a younger generation.[517][310] Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music;[518] her guitar performances contributed to the \"Taylor Swift factor\", a phenomenon to which an upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.[519][520]\\nAccording to publications, Swift changed the music landscape with her genre transitions, a discography that accommodates cultural shifts,[521] and her ability to popularize any sound in mainstream music.[522] Lyrically, in being personal and vulnerable in her songs, music journalist Nick Catucci opined Swift helped make space for later singers like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the
